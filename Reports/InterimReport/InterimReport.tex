\section{Introduction}
Swarms exist everywhere in life. Nearly all organisms exhibit some form of swarming behaviours within their
communities. Starlings display impressive organisational behaviour, positioning themselves with respect to the
movement of their neighbours. Humans show swarm behaviours when moving in crowds, for example, moving around sports
venues or exiting buildings in emergencies. No matter how hard you look, regardless if the context, swarms are
typically present.\\
These behaviours can also be artificially created in robotics. Within the realm of computing, parallelising
processes is breaking barrier after barrier - swarm robotics brings the same benefits. Being able to divide and
conquer a problem has the ability to reduce computational complexity by whole orders of magnitude. Therefore, it
would be wasteful not to properly dedicate the time which this discipline deserves.\\
My agents will be placed within close proximity inside a simulated environment and then allowed to explore and
combine their findings; ultimately creating a visualization map of its environment. The agents will need to both
navigate the environment and avoid collisions, whilst creating an internal representation of its surroundings. The
best-case scenario for the swarm I am developing is a fully decentralised system in simulation.\\
I will initially explore this problem by creating SLAM simulations, and then attempting to apply similar techniques
to a centralised system. These initial simulations will employ techniques such as particle filters, loop closures
and [insert something here] in order to create a base-line representation of the environment.

\section{Professional and Ethical Considerations}
My project maintains compliance towards all ethical considerations, as there is minimal external involvement from
humans. The majority of my project will be carried out in simulation, therefore no ethical approval is required. Should
my project progress to physically implementing agents, considerations such as safety around the robots, will be considered.
All tests will be carried out in an environment where people cannot be hit, therefore mitigating any trip hazards.\\
Research in this project is within the professional competence of myself, as it significantly relies upon knowledge
obtained from modules such as "Acquired Intelligence and Adaptive Behaviour" and "Fundamentals of Machine Learning." I
will further ensure all relevant gaps in knowledge are explored through reading extensively in the area and communicating
any areas of concern with my supervisor.
